            <h2>FLYAWAY : <br> EMERGENCY AFGHAN RESCUE MISSION</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We are coming to you in desperation to conduct an emergency flight rescue of 300+ Afghan souls. I have been working alongside humanitarian aid groups, decorated military veterans, and activists on the ground in Kabul, fighting to save people who otherwise have no chance at survival in the Taliban-occupied Kabul. 
                <br> Due to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Kabul, this rescue mission will only be possible if $550,000 is raised to fuel 2 airplanes to fly into Kabul from a foreign country.  If we raise twice the amount ($1,100,000), weâ€™ll do another run. There are enough people in need to make many round-trips with our two airplanes. We will continue multiplying as goals are met. 
            </p>
