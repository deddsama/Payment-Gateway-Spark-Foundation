     <h1> FLYAWAY: EMERGENCY AFGHAN RESCUE MISSION</h1>
<p class="one">We are coming to you in desperation to conduct an emergency flight rescue of 300+ Afghan souls. I have been working alongside humanitarian aid groups, decorated military veterans, and activists on the ground in Kabul, fighting to save people who otherwise have no chance at survival in the Taliban-occupied Kabul.
<br>The individuals in question are high-value targets - Afghan men and women who have worked as human rights lawyers, champions of Women’s and LGBTQ rights, journalists, government liaisons, artists, and interpreters - all of whom are at imminent risk of being executed by the Taliban, along with their families. We will be taking full family units.
<br>If these people do not get rescued as soon as possible, neither they nor their family will make it through the month. The Taliban have a KILL LIST and are going door to door, searching for these people and reportedly killing them on sight if found. Every one of these individuals on the manifest have been vetted.
<br>With help from people on the ground in Kabul, and the newfound security of the airport due to increased US presence — we have arranged for a safe onboarding process. All of the people who will be boarding the planes have been extensively vetted.</p>
